    """Trigger a password reset for a specified user account.

    Use this tool when a user requests a password reset for their own account
    or reports being locked out. The reset link will be sent to their registered
    email address.

    IMPORTANT: You need the user's email address for target_user. First, try to
    look up the user's Slack profile to get their email address. If the lookup fails
    or does not return an email, ask the user for their email address. Never guess
    or assume — you must either look it up or ask for it.

    Args:
        ctx: The run context with dependencies.
        target_user: The email address of the user whose password should be reset.
